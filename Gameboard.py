"""Gameboard objects

This file contains all of the battleship game mechanics code
It includes the board objects, node objects, and a helper method to determine the adjacent node in a given direction

A good possibility for refactoring is to add a Ship class; I have a couple inconsistent ways of representing them
throughout my code, and it would be an improvement to streamline that.
