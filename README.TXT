This Battleship code will only render somewhat properly in a terminal with full Unicode support (which most don't), and is only tested thoroughly in Pycharm on my device, which is running Windows 10. It'll probably display well in Pycharm on most devices, and might display acceptably on monospaced fonts like Courier New in other terminals with unicode support, but the only environment that it officially supports is Pycharm with the 'monospaced' font on Windows.
